## Some rules


You will control the player with the space key to jump, and the left and right arrows to move forward or backward. 

After pressing "start" button, you will go to the first level, there are seven levels in total. On the screen you will see a door through which you can go to the next level, but on the way you must collect coins avoiding obstacles like blob and lava..

I advice everyone to try to play it at least one time. I am sure you also gonna love it. Thanks to the developer for this game! (Aida Osmonova)

So. The game. I haven't played games for a long time. The game is very interesting. I have a nostalgia. I'm a man who played mario. The game is dynamic. The interface is clean.
Control is simple. I hope you will develop the game further in the future. (Saidillaev Erkin)

I really enjoy playing this kind of games - it has an infinite number of advantages. In my opinion, it is really amazing that Sacral made it. We must thank her for creativity! (Libs - Elira Akimbaeva)

In my opinion it is a graet job, cause it is easy to control the player and get the finish door. Also it has several levels according to hardness , so that you will not get bored. It made me remember my childhood. (Abykaev Dastan)

As a child, I often played platformer games with my dad, for me it was the coolest game at that time. Even though the idea is really simple, itâ€™s a really cool concept.This game is honestly the best 2D game I have ever played. Thanks Sacral (dongolok) for her hard work. (Amir Alimzhanov)
