## Some rules


You will control the player with the space key to jump, and the left and right arrows to move forward or backward. 

After pressing "start" button, you will go to the first level, there are seven levels in total. On the screen you will see a door through which you can go to the next level, but on the way you must collect coins avoiding obstacles like blob and lava..

Omg, firstly i want to say, is that game done very nice and cute. I liked so much selected sprites, they fit very awesome. Secondly, creativity of Nuriza surprized me, it is not simple snake or space war game which do every second guy, it is really 2d full game, ready for uploading. I like the idea, I like the realization. Everything works perfect and well-balanced. In my opinion, it is the best game project, that I ever seen in University. Moreover I like the levels realization, I thought it will be only 1 level game, but there were morem than I expected what also surprized me. Nice job done by Nuriza. Cool project!

I like her project because when I was a child, I always played Mario game and when I saw Nuriza’s game it reminded me my childhood. Her game is clear and comfortable, I played her game around 5-8 times. I think this game is cool for starting game developer. (Medina Isabekova - faculty president)
